The heart begins to suffer when the soul has given up
And the flesh is barely more than bone
When no one else is listening, only when you've had enough
Time to sing this dying song alone
Put your hands into the water
Let your mouth go sick and dry
Put your life into your death now
Let them sing until you die
Die, die, die, yeah
